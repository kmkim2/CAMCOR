# Context aware multi-token concept recognition of biological entities

Background: 
Concept recognition is a term that corresponds to the two sequential steps of named entity recognition and named entity normalization, and plays an essential role in the field of bioinformatics. However, the conventional dictionary-based methods did not sufficiently cope with the variation of the concepts in actual usage, resulting in the problematic performances particularly in recognition of multi-token concepts.

Results: 
In this paper, we propose a concept recognition method of multi-token biological entities using neural models combined with literature contexts. The key aspect of our method is utilizing the contextual information from the biological knowledge-bases for concept normalization, which is followed by named entity recognition procedure. The model showed improved performances over conventional methods, particularly for multi-token concepts with higher variations.

Conclusions: 
 expect that our model can be utilized for effective concept recognition and variety of natural language processing tasks on bioinformatics.
